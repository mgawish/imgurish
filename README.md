# Imgurish
Imgurish is client app for the Imgur platform built using SwiftUI and Combine. 

# Imgur API
https://api.imgur.com

The app is regitered on the imgur platform and it not inteneded to make any profit. This is more a proof of concept.
To be able to run the app directly from the repo you would need to register with the Imgur API and add the client-id and client-secret in the `AppKeys.plist`
